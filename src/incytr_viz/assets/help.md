### Introduction

The purpose of this tool is to interact with outputs generated by the [Incytr pathway discovery tool](https://github.com/ChanghanGitHub/Incytr) (citation to be added). 

The left and right panels correspond to pathway data for the two user-provided experimental conditions, as named in the cell clusters input file. For information on input formatting, see the [project README](https://github.com/cellsignal/incytr-viz/blob/main/README.md).

### Filtering

- By default, each condition panel displays pathways upregulated (by adjusted fold change "aFC") in that condition. The panel on the left (labeled with a "+") corresponds to the condition with positive aFC values, and the panel on the right with negative aFC values. This can be disabled in the options tab (uncheck 'Restrict on aFC direction')

- Filters available include:

  - Sender cell population
  - Receiver cell population
  - Ligand/Receptor/EM/Target Gene
  - Gene --> display pathways containing selected genes regardless of pathway role
  - Kinase interaction --> if available, select pathways with a signaling-involed kinase (SiK) relationship between components. For example, filtering on "Receptor --> EM" displays pathways where the receptor is a predicted kinase of the effector molecule (as reported in the SiK_R_of_EM column of the pathways file, if available).
  

- Filters are applied additively (a pathway must pass all filters in order to be displayed). Except for UMAP-based filtering, filters are applied to both conditions simultaneously. 

- Some metrics (e.g. signalling probability and p-value) are reported separately for each condition. In these cases, each panel will be filtered according to the relevant column for that condition (e.g. SigProb_5X or SigProb_WT).


### Network View

- The network view shows the number of 4-step networks occurring between various cell types, subject to the applied filter.

- By default, node area is logarithmically (log2) proportional to the cluster's population share within the total cell population for the condition, and edge widths are linearly proportional to the raw number of pathways the edge represents. Node and edge sizing can be adjusted in the options tab for visual clarity, as datasets vary significantly. These are intended as guidelines -- for exact data, please select 'Show network weights' and/or 'Show cluster population sizes' in the options tab.

- Click on an edge to display its component pathways in the river view, filtered on the relevant sender and receiver cell populations



### River view

- Displays the ligand/receptor/EM/target gene components of the 4-step networks
- Click on a node in the pathway to filter for pathways containing that gene in the same role
- Depending on the number of unique targets passing the filter, targets may be hidden until additional filters are applied.
- In the options tab, use the "Color Sankey Flow" tab to color-code the pathways by sender cell type, receiver cell type, or by kinase-substrate relationship

### Downloading Data

Click "Download Current Paths" to download a CSV of pathways passing the currently selected filters. Two files will download - one named for each experimental condition (your browser may ask you to allow the program to download multiple files).


### UMAP

Users can append their own umap data to the pathway data in order to filter on umap coordinates.

1. Ensure each pathway in your input file has columns "umap1" and "umap2", each corresponding to that pathway's umap coordinates
2. Run incytr, and select the "Show UMAP" option in the options tab to display umap plots for each condition
3. Selecting an region of the umap plot will restrict displayed pathways to those found in that region

- UMAP filtering is condition-specific: filtering on the left/right-hand UMAP only affects the left/right-hand panel, allowing two different UMAP regions to be compared.
- All points remain on the UMAP plot regardless of pathway filters applied


### Troubleshooting

- Targets may not be displayed when there are too many unique links in the river plot. Please apply additional filters.
- Filters are applied additively. If an expected pathway is not appearing, it may be that it passes, e.g.,  the current TPDS filter but not PPDS. Try loosening one or more of the filters.
- Some filters may be disabled if the metric is not detected or unavailable. Please see the terminal output on startup for a report on what metrics were detected.
- Large files (~1M pathways) may take slightly longer to load and render. Applying additional filters will reduce load times. 
- Check terminal window for additional informative output
